The presentation deals with the current development status of the CesiumJS library as well as the standards and possible uses of individual features and shows some examples from a recent project, in which we presented underground 3D geodata. Thus, this contribution can be seen as a renewal of our 2013 FOSS4G contribution entitled \"Modelling 3D Underground Data In A Web-based 3D-Client\".\r\n\r\nNot only are web-based open source 3D applications with a geographic reference constantly developing, but the development of standards and specifications for the presentation of 3D data on the web has also increasingly come into focus. A large number of libraries can be used for the representation on the web (e.g. x3dom, o3d, threejs, BabylonJS, Open GEE). Another library that has been growing steadily for several years is CesiumJS. This is used to process geographical questions in numerous areas. These include the real estate market, urban planning, sports or the various environmental sciences.\r\n\r\nIn our talk we will present the current development status of the library and some possible use-cases of the features and data of CesiumJS will be briefly presented using projects as examples. A focus will also be placed on the requirements of the browser. In addition to the general availability and provision of data, the possible uses of individual selected features of the library will also be presented and discussed.",

    "speakers": "Alex Orenstein, Laure Boudinaud",
    "abstract": "In Central Mali, climate change, food insecurity and growing conflicts over land use necessitate being able to localize areas of food production (Benjaminsen, 2018) . The region’s heavy reliance on subsistence agriculture livelihoods means that humanitarian actors must quickly assess changes in cropland to plan the distribution of food aid. Typically, in the absence of extensive field data, publicly available land cover datasets are used to identify cropland cover. While the proliferation of such datasets (e.g. ESA-CCI or GlobeLand30) has increased over the years, they are often ill-adjusted to the Sahelian context. Assessments conducted of cropland identified by the most used land cover datasets found that none were able to meet the 75% accuracy threshold in Sahelian West Africa (Samasse et al, 2019). While countries like Mali are among those most critically in need of cropland mapping, the current toolkit of landcover data is woefully inadequate for the needs of humanitarian actors.\r\nTo address this gap, the “3-Period TimeScan” (3PTS) was developed using Google Earth Engine (Gorelick et al., 2017). This product consists of a Red-Green-Blue composite of Sentinel-2 Images where the red band represents the maximum NDVI value during the first period of the growing season, the green the maximum NDVI in the middle, and the blue the maximum NDVI at the end. This condensation of the agricultural season’s temporal evolution singles out cropland from other landcover types. A highly localized cropland change analysis was conducted comparing the 2019 3PTS product with the one of 2017, a year prior to the start of the Central Mali’s conflict. The change status was visually determined per populated site, as supervised classifications required exhaustive manual cleaning to produce a reliable product over such a large and ecologically heterogenous zone. The resulting map was compared with georeferenced data of conflict events, indicating a strong spatial correlation between violence and cropland reductions.",

This leads to the user complaining to everyone that this snarkiness is not a welcoming response or how unreasonable it is to expect them to learn to program, or to pay. The discussion often descends into a rambling maze of twisty insults and justifications. When the fuss dies down, all the developers go back to doing what they the were doing something useful and the user becomes either a dissatisfied user or an ex-user. This talk by two veteran open source developers will help users see that play out from our the developer point of view.

    "speakers": "Dylan Halpern",
    "abstract": "In-browser analytics have grown in popularity as personal computers and mobile devices have increased capabilities in CPU and GPU performance to handle and represent geospatial data.  Efficient data transfer formats, in-memory analytics, and cheap static or serverless web infrastructures set the groundwork for robust client-side data handling, parsing, and visualization. Additionally, the ongoing development of WebAssembly libraries, a web technology to wrap and translate existing modules from C, Go, Rust, Python, Java, etc. into a JavaScript virtual machine with near-native performance, opens the door to integrate existing work into new web applications. \r\n\r\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a research coalition led by the Center for Spatial Data Science at UChicago developed a first-of-its-kind dashboard that enables client-side analytics to perform spatial autocorrelation methods (LISA / Local Moran’s I) and binning algorithms including jenks natural breaks and hinge breaks directly in the client-side environment. The advances open up new possibilities for inexpensively hosted geospatial web applications with more robust analytic capacities than previously possible, all while utilizing free or low-cost web hosting services. Additionally, new visualization methods utilizing powerful WebGL-based geospatial libraries (Deck.gl, Kepler.gl) allow for more complex on-the-fly visualizations such as point-grid layers and dot density maps with robust filtering options.\r\nThis talk outlines the infrastructure used in the US Covid Atlas project and the capacities of jsgeoda (Xun Li, CSDS) to perform a variety of clustering and binning algorithms in the browser. Code demonstrations for main thread and worker implementations will be presented, along with a series of template Github repositories available for use licensed under GPL. By the end of this talk, viewers will be able to understand and replicate the US Covid Atlas’s web infrastructure, implement a simple jsgeoda instance for spatial clustering, and build from open source templates for their own geospatial analytics web application that does not require backend services.",

The input and output geospatial data follows the main OGS standards and can be visualized within anyone’s preferred GIS.\r\n\r\nIn the last year a set of modules of the SpatialToolbox have been developed to perform geomorphological analysis to automatically delineate a hierarchical structure of basins and subbasins  for a selected area. The result of the analysis will be the input of the integral distributed hydrological model GEOframe. The GEOframe application is a complex system with more than 50 components used to simulate the complete hydrological cycle within a watershed (Spatial extrapolation/interpolation of meteorological variables; Estimation of the radiation budget, evapotranspiration, runoff production; Simulation of infiltration; Calibration).\r\n\r\nThe first tool is an improvement of the original NetNumbering algorithm with a new feature to homogenize the area of the extracted basins and, at the same time, it saves the hierarchical structure of the basins which can be used to navigate the network upstream and downstream.

    "speakers": "Jesus Rodrigo Cedeno Jimenez",
    "abstract": "Nowadays, the amount of open geospatial data delivered e.g. by private and public entities, such as environmental agencies, enables outstanding possibilities to any user interested in investigating real-world phenomena. However, the availability of such information presents several challenges in terms of its practical use. These are mainly connected to the heterogeneity of data sources, formats and processing tools which have to be mastered by the user to obtain the desired results. As a relevant example, air quality monitoring requires the integration of multiple data with different spatial and temporal granularities that are often distributed by more than one provider using not uniform formats and access methods. Besides traditional air pollution ground sensors observations, novel data sources have emerged. Among them, the Sentinel-5P mission of the European Copernicus Programme is one of the most recent Earth Observation platforms providing estimates of air pollutants with daily global coverage. These estimates are promising to foster air quality analysis and monitoring by complementing ground sensors observations. Therefore, the development of data handling and analysis strategies - allowing users for a smooth integration of satellite and ground sensor observations - is key to support future air quality studies. To that end, the present work investigates the use of the Open Data Cube as a single data endpoint to incorporate ground sensors and satellite observations into local air pollution analyses. A preliminary implementation is presented using the Lombardy region (Northern Italy) as a case study.",

Due to the regular recordings, large areas could be continuously monitored and evaluated for the Department of Defense. Until 1995, more than 800,000 photos remained secret and were then made publicly available by the US Geological Survey on the order of President Bill Clinton. The high-resolution CORONA photos (2 m to 60 cm pixel resolution) are available as scans for a fee from the USGS and represent a unique source of information for science, archaeology and other disciplines. Since the camera systems of the CORONA satellites have a special panoramic distortion, common linear methods cannot be used for the orthorectification of the scans. mundialis has developed an innovative free and open source technology to rectify these unreferenced scans of CORONA photos to current map references and published it in GRASS GIS 7.9. This photogrammetric solution models the CORONA camera mathematically and thus enables a precise referencing of the CORONA data. In many parts of the world, the CORONA scenes have preserved images of a landscape that predates the most intrusive infrastructural and land-use projects of modern times. Traditional architecture, agricultural patterns and settlement systems can be observed in great clarity on CORONA imagery. This makes CORONA a precious resource in fields such as archaeological and historical geography.",

In the circumstance of these limitations, we need to think more innovatively to look for some ways to keep the action of this community. We do not want this pandemic to dampen our enthusiasm for developing the newly formed community. one of the keys to deal with tough situations is adaptation. Upon the limitations to meet physically, we plan some events whereby all participants may join from everywhere, even without the need to leave their house.\r\nIn this talk, we manage to build the QGIS ID community by creating several online events and also what challenges that we faced.

To enhance our understanding, NASA’s Earth Science Division (ESD) employs a fleet of satellites equipped with sensors that collect petabytes worth of Earth observations aimed to help scientists and researchers learn more. NASA has the unique vantage point to see the bigger picture and identify more valuable, expansive uses of data previously siloed by a specific research question or hazard type. NASA’s ESD missions give researchers unprecedented insights into Earth’s systems and are driven by the integration and harmonization of data sources from multiple spatial scales. \r\nNASA Earth science data provide a wealth of information to aid in our understanding of Earth’s processes, in the development of innovative solutions for real-world challenges, and in making data-based decisions. These datasets, which cover even the most remote areas of Earth, are freely and openly available to anyone but not always intuitively discoverable and accessible in GIS formats. NASA’s Earth Science Data Systems (ESDS) program and Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) have developed resources and tools to overcome this challenge. In this talk, we will demonstrate resources for geospatial analysts wishing to get started using NASA data. There is a growing need for NASA data to be GIS-ready for easy integration and analysis in the primary tools employed by user communities. Join us to learn about how NASA Earth Science is enabling data through services, applications and story maps and distributing content through online platforms. Learn about our Earthdata community space and GIS Data Pathfinder, developed to guide users to numerous geospatial web services and tools to access GIS-ready data.

    "speakers": "Michaël Douchin",
    "abstract": "PgMetadata is made for people using QGIS as their main GIS application, and PostgreSQL as their main vector data storage.\r\n\r\nThe layers metadata are stored inside your PostgreSQL database, in a dedicated schema. Classical fields are supported, such as the title, description, categories, themes, links, and the spatial properties of your data.\r\n\r\nPgMetadata is not designed as a catalog application which lets you search among datasets and then download the data. It is designed to ease the use of the metadata inside QGIS, allowing to search for a data and open the corresponding layer, or to view the metadata of the already loaded PostgreSQL layers.\r\n\r\nBy storing the metadata of the vector tables inside the database:\r\n\r\n* QGIS can read the metadata easily by using the layer PostgreSQL connection: a dock panel shows the metadata for the active layer when the plugin detects metadata exists for this QGIS layer.\r\n* QGIS can run SQL queries: you can use the QGIS locator search bar to search for a layer, and load it easily in your project.\r\n\r\nThe administrator in charge of editing the metadata will also benefit from the PostgreSQL storage:\r\n\r\n* PostgreSQL/PostGIS functions are used to automatically update some fields based on the table data (the layer extent, geometry type, feature count, projection, etc.).\r\n* The metadata is saved with your data anytime you backup the database\r\n* You do not need to share XML files across the network or install a new catalog application to manage your metadata and allow the users to get it.\r\n\r\nThe plugin contains some processing algorithms to help the administrator. For example:\r\n\r\n* a script helps to create or update the needed \"pgmetadata\" PostgreSQL schema and tables in your database\r\n* a algorithm creates a QGIS project suitable for the metadata editing. This project uses the power of QGIS to create a rich user interface allowing to edit your metadata easily (forms, relations). Why use another interface when QGIS rocks ?\r\n\r\nMore PgMetadata features will be shown during the presentation:\r\n\r\n* Modification of the template to tune the displayed metadata\r\n* Export a metadata dataset to PDF, HTML or DCAT\r\n* Publish the metadata as a DCAT catalog with Lizmap Web Client module for PgMetadata. It can then be harvested by external applications (Geonetwork, CKAN)\r\n* The data model is very close to the QGIS metadata storage and the DCAT vocabulary for compatibility.",

This leads to lack of coordination and can cause management and decision-making processes to be delayed or not have the spatial information updated in real time.\r\n\r\nThis success case shows the development of a general interface for the integration of spatial information in the worflow of general purpose applications by establishing communication interfaces based on OGC protocols and Open Source tool capabilities, acording to the following workflow:\r\n\r\n* Workflow process identification and sending of information in JSON format.\r\n* Representation of the general purpose information using OGC protocols.\r\n* Editing of the spatial and alphanumeric file information via OGC protocols.\r\n* Consolidation of spatial information in the central processing repository.\r\n\r\nIn this way, by means of Open Source technologies, instantaneous updating of the spatial information associated with procedures is carried out in real time through the use of OGC protocols and Open Source technologies.\r\n\r\nThis success case proves how, through standard-based interfaces, the absolute integration of spatial data in a centralised repository is achieved and managed in the data production processes in an instantaneous way, resulting in a unified product that allows the processing and management of procedures with spatial information updated in real time. \r\n\r\nTechnologies: PostGIS, GeoServer, OpenLayers, Mapea, OGC standards, GeoJSON, REST API",

It is also useful for generating the style/legend from the uploaded geospatial data. Thus, generated legend can be used for visualization of maps in the web-GIS platform. The package is successfully used to build the web-GIS portal for agricultural datasets of Afghanistan, which has around 6000 map layers. The main benefit that geoserver-rest provides to this project is the ability to upload the data to the geoserver and create the styles file dynamically. Thus, created style files are directly linked to the corresponding layer and provide the Web Mapping Service (WMS) standard and visualize in an interactive way.",

    "abstract": "Floodplain wetlands play a key role in hydrological and biogeochemical cycles and comprise a large part of the world's biodiversity and resources. The exploitation of remote sensing data can substantially contribute to monitoring procedures at broad ecological scales. In 2020, the Lower Paraná River floodplain (also known as Paraná River Delta, Argentina) suffered from a severe drought, and extended areas were burned. To monitor the wildfire situation, satellite products provided by FIRMS-NASA were used. These thermal hotspots —associated with active fires— can be downloaded as zipped spatial objects (point shapefiles) and include recent and archive records from VIRRS and MODIS thermal infrared sensors. The main aim was to handle these data, analyze the number of hotspots during 2020, and compare the disaster with previous years' situation. Using a reproducible workflow was crucial to ingest the zip files and repeat the same series of plots and analyses when necessary. Obtaining updated reports allowed me to quickly respond to peers, technicians, and journalists about the evolving fire situation. A total of 39,821 VIIRS S-NPP thermal hotspots were detected, with August (winter) accounting for 39.8% of the whole year’s hotspots. MODIS hotspots have lower spatial resolution than VIIRS, so the cumulative MODIS hotspots recorded during 2020 were 8,673, the highest number of hotspots of the last 11 years. Scripts were written in R language and are shared under a CC BY 4.0 license. QGIS was also used to generate a high-quality animation. The workflow can be used in other study areas.",

    "speakers": "Carla Rodriguez Gonzalez, Elisa Frank Buss, Yelvis Acevedo",
    "abstract": "Leishmaniasis encompasses a group of vector-borne parasitic diseases, characterized by their diversity and complexity, that affect both humans and other vertebrates. They are caused by different species of parasites of the Leishmania genus, which are transmitted by bites from hematophagous female sandflies.  This work proposed to model the occurrence probability of five sandflies species of sanitary interest for South America, from a bibliographic compilation of records of the last 10 years. To develop the model, the free software MaxEnt was used. This exploratory analysis made it possible to visualize the areas where the species are distributed. In addition, we analyzed land changes in vegetation around a town in Jujuy province, Argentina, where a leishmaniasis outbreak occurred  during  the  years  2017  and  2018.   For  this,  Sentinel-2  images  were  used,  and  a  change  vector  was  calculated  for  the difference between two dates of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). This part of the work was made using SNAP software  for  images  pre-procesing,  Python  for  the  change  vector  obtention  and  QGIS  for  the  result  post-procesing.   From  the exploration of MaxEnt software we were able to know the most suitable places for the distribution of the most important five species in the study region, and therefore, to project future decision-making to prevent and control leishmaniasis transmission. And in turn, obtain an approximation of how anthropogenic activities, as deforestation, can have an influence on leishmaniasis specific outbreaks transmitted by these species.  Finally, from the exploration of the different tools used in this work, the importance of validation with field data for the generation of accurate analyses and predictions is highlighted. It implies that more data collection is necessary to validate the models and analyzes generated, to guarantee the contribution of the tools in macro-ecological studies of species linked to disease transmission.",

    "speakers": "Philippe Rufin",
    "abstract": "Current Earth Observation applications heavily rely on analyses of dense intra-annual or inter-annual time series. State-of-the-art analysis workflows thus require mass processing of satellite data, with data volumes easily exceeding several terabytes, even for relatively small areas of interest. Cloud processing platforms such as Google EarthEngine (GEE) leverage accessibility to satellite image archives and facilitate time series analysis workflows. Instant visualization of time series data, though, is currently not implemented or requires coding customized scripts or applications. We here present the GEE Timeseries Explorer which allows instant access to any Earth Engine image collection from within QGIS. It seamlessly integrates the QGIS UI with a compact widget for visualizing time series from any GEE image collection graphically as an interactive plot, or spatially as images with customized band rendering.",

    "speakers": "John Duncan, Ahi Saipaia",
    "abstract": "In Pacific Island Countries, the environmental resources that support livelihoods are distributed across landscapes in a mix of spatial patterns. Capturing the spatial detail of landscape use is important to inform landscape management that is sensitive to these livelihood dependencies. Using information and communication technologies for development (ICT4D) and agile software development processes, a workflow was developed that comprises open-source geospatial software to map and monitor agricultural landscapes. This workflow was co-developed with the Vava’u branch of the Ministry of Agriculture, Food, Forests, and Fisheries (MAFF) of the Government of Tonga.\r\n\r\nThe workflow consists of mobile GIS to map farms, web-applications to synchronise and store data, and spatial dashboards for data visualisation and analysis. Mobile geospatial data collection uses QField for intra-farm mapping of cropping practices and digital forms to record farm management attributes. A web application has been developed using Express and Python to support data syncing, automatically generating datasets for reporting on cropping practices and landscape conditions, and for secure data storage. A spatial dashboard, built using Shiny and Leaflet, allows non-GIS experts to easily query and visualise landscape data collected in the field and to use this data in landscape decision making. \r\n\r\nThis workflow has been used by MAFF for an array of data collection and mapping campaigns. Example uses include: mapping the location of vanilla plantations under sub-optimal management condition; identifying where land was under-utilised or left fallow by farmer groups to spatially target fuel and cash resources to increase land under cultivation; and annual crop monitoring to generate island-wide coverage of intra-farm cropping practices to serve as baseline data to track agricultural change through time.\r\n\r\nThis talk will discuss the software development process including: the needs assessment to identify and prioritise unmet needs for geospatial data and applications; requirements identification and analysis using use case modelling and rapid prototype development and testing; and refinement and deployment of the workflow for agricultural landscape monitoring on the island group of Vava’u. This talk will also elaborate on the implementations of the workflow, highlight lessons learnt through the development process, and highlight areas for future work and expansion.",

This talk will introduce an example of UNVT deployment at UN and other examples including vector map delivery using Raspberry pi. \r\n\r\n   After development of the basic toolsets by early 2020, we started developing an open source vector tile web map service in UN. At each phase of the vector tile development (i.e. data conversion, styling, hosting and optimizing), UNVT was utilized to proceed the process efficiently.  At the first phase, the production phase, we have converted the vector tile of the whole world and updated them weekly with the developed nodejs script and Tippecanoe. The source data is stored in PostGIS data base and extracted by tile by tile due to its large data size. At the following styling phase, in order to efficiently develop a style fie, a hocon file was prepared for each style layer, then compiled into a single style json. At hosting phase, we have developed nodejs based simple vector tile hosting server which deliver the pbf files derived from mbitiles upon each request. \r\n\r\n   Recently, UNVT has been used even outside the United Nations.

    "speakers": "Charlotte Flasse",
    "abstract": "Socio-economic and demographic data is often released at the level of census administrative units. However, there is often a need for data available at a higher spatial resolution. Dasymetric mapping is an approach that has, in recent decades, increasingly received attention in order to exploit socio-economic data for spatially detailed analysis and/or to explore spatial phenomena that do not follow existing administrative units (the modifiable areal unit problem). This approach can be used to disaggregate such data into finer levels of detail, relying on the assumption that proxies available at a higher spatial resolution, typically as land-cover (LC) / land-use (LU) maps, can be used to produce weights in order to spatially reallocate the data to a finer scale layer. \r\n\r\nFor a long time, these weights have been subjectively determined based on expert knowledge, where higher weights are attributed to urban areas, slightly lower weights to suburban or rural areas, and a weight of zero for forest areas or water bodies. Recent research, however, has shifted this paradigm by taking advantage of the power and the efficiency of machine learning (ML) algorithms to create weighting layers for dasymetric mapping without any a priori knowledge.\r\n\r\nThis session will present a tool that has been developed to provide non-programmer users with a ready-to-use tool to create weighting layers using ML for dasymetric mapping. This tool is implemented as a GRASS GIS add-on and will be accessible on the official repository. It will facilitate the implementation of a machine learning-based approach to produce weighting layers for dasymetric mapping of socio-economic variables. We will demonstrate its ability to perform dasymetric mapping of population data based on earth observation (EO) derived products such as LC and LU maps.",

SenCast (https://gitlab.com/eawag-rs/sencast) is a Python toolbox for downloading Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 images and computing water quality parameters, and Datalakes (https://www.datalakes-eawag.ch/), is an open data platform for accessing, visualising and comparing heterogeneous environmental data. Together they form an operational pipeline that facilitates easy access to EO data and allows the joint interpretation of spatial patterns from satellite observations, 3D hydrodynamic simulations and in-situ measurements from vertical profilers and moorings. This proof of concept at a national scale shows how countries can produce accurate water quality information in line with the SDG indicator 6.3.2 monitoring requirements.",

    "abstract": "Iaso is a platform created to support geo-rich data collection efforts, mainly in public health in emerging countries. The key feature that it supports is that any survey is linked to an organizational unit that is part of a canonical hierarchy. Each one of these org. units can have a location and a territory. The mobile data collection tool can be used to enrich this hierarchy with additional GPS coordinates, names corrections, etc ... which can then be validated by officials of the organizations in question through the web dashboard (this is consequently similar in some aspects to OpenStreetMap, but with validation before integration in the reference dataset). This leads to continuous improvements of the geographic references available through the routine activities already planned (e.g. locating and registering health facilities while investigating malaria cases).  \r\n\r\nThe tool has been used in multiple data collection efforts, notably in health services in D.R. Congo, Niger, Cameroon, Mali and Nigeria and is more and more used to compare multiple versions of official organisational hierarchies when a canonical one needs to be rebuilt. We are for example working on such efforts to rebuild a school map for DRC with the NGO Cordaid. To help for this type of project, we provide location selection interfaces, multiple levels of audits and an API open to data scientists for analysis and mass edits.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will demo the main features of the platform, and give some context about its creation.\r\n\r\nIaso has been created by the company Bluesquare (https://bluesquarehub.com/, based in Belgium), specialised in software and services for public health, and has become open source under the MIT License in November 2020. \r\n\r\nIt is still under heavy development, but is already the basis of at least a dozen projects. On the roadmap, we have features for a patient registry, monitoring tools for data collectors, and microplanning activities (producing routes for monitoring teams, or vaccination teams).\r\n\r\nIaso is made of a white labeled Android application using Java/Kotlin and reusing large parts of the ODK projects and a web platform programmed using Python/GeoDjango on top of PostGIS. Frontend is mainly React/Leaflet. One of the aims is the ease of integration with other platforms. We already have csv and geopackage imports and exports and target easy integration with OSM.",

This process proved difficult to scale with increasing ingest rates and led to standardizing imagery pipeline outputs on Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs(COGs) with rio-tiler, pyproj, GDAL , Shapely, and Rasterio for processing to define dynamic rendering visualization products in a newly developed STAC-compliant catalog. The Sparkgeo team has written a custom Global Imagery Search tool for our corporate OpenLayers-enabled application framework which combines event-based per-scene visualization processing with STAC search results and TMS-to-COG range/column searches.

The effective creation of canopy data is of utmost importance to analyze the aforementioned processes in addition to forest patterns such as disturbance, mortality, and the societal and economic effects forests can provide. Because of the importance of forests and the cycles they are apart of, it is imperative that systems are created that enable the effective monitoring of forest canopy. In particular, canopy classification using remotely sensed data plays an essential role in monitoring tree canopy on a large scale.

    "speakers": "Rosa Aguilar",
    "abstract": "Collaborative spatial planning tackles problems that often require the active participation of different stakeholders who might have different kinds of knowledge, values and interests. Maptables, specifically large horizontal touch screens, can be used to support collaborative spatial planning processes  given the enhanced communication and playful environment they provide. However, frequently used applications for maptables, i.e., GIS software,  do not exploit the touch capabilities of these instruments or have usability shortcomings because they were conceived for a single-user setting. To address this gap, we developed and evaluated an open source application coined OGITO - Open Geospatial Interactive Tool. We combined human-centred design methods and Agile software development principles involving stakeholders and intended users in an iterative co-creation process of the tool and evaluated the tool’s usability in a case study on community mapping in Sumatra, Indonesia. \r\n\r\nWe found that case study workshop participants, who never used a maptable before, could use OGITO without assistance after receiving a short instruction. They reported high satisfaction with OGITO for the tasks and context given.  This result shows the added value of iterative development and user feedback for improving and further development of the tool’s usability and functionality.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the platform provided by OGITO facilitated the group interaction allowing for communication and collaboration when creating maps. This experience would contribute in building trust and mutual understanding, which might help participants to collaborate in other community initiatives. The main observed benefits of using OGITO were: a) simple to use as it only requires a small room and a facilitator during the map-making process; b) that it accommodates capturing of participants' local knowledge that is priceless and rich with information that might not be transferrable or explicitly spoken; c) that it reduces editing mistakes at the map post-processing stage because participants draw their sketches in the digital tool using a high-resolution satellite image as a reference instead of the traditional community mapping method, which uses markers and paper during the map-creation process.\r\n\r\nFuture work aim to advance the current version of OGITO considering the feedback collected during the usability evaluation. Also, we will include analytical functionality, as the current version excluded calculation functions that were not demanded by the users.",

It is an application where the user can configure the map to their own taste and needs, allowing the choice of the portion of territory that the map will contain, the scale (within a range) and even the personalisation of the title and cover of the map. It also allows drawing points, lines and polygons on the cartography that can be labelled, or inserting other geographic data such as those that can be registered on a route on foot by means of a GPS, or other types of information downloaded from the Internet in different formats.\r\n\r\nFor the development, a solution has been designed consisting of several Open Source software components. The front-end, an intuitive environment programmed in React JS, interacts with the spatial reference information by consuming the map services provided by the API-IGN, the IGN Search geographic name searches, as well as the OGC WMTS visualisation services of IGN cartography. This set of services allows the user to define the conditions of the desired map that MapFish will finally generate, in high resolution PDF format.

    "abstract": "Natural hazards such as landslides, whether they are driven by meteorologic or seismic processes, are constantly shaping Earth’s surface. In large percentage of the slope failures, they are also causing huge human and economic losses. As the problem is complex in its nature, proper mitigation and prevention strategies are not straightforward to implement. One important step in the correct direction is the integration of different fields; as such, in this work, we are providing a general overview of approaches and techniques which are adopted and integrated for landslide monitoring and mapping, as both activities are important in the risk prevention strategies. Detailed landslide inventory is important for providing the correct information of the phenomena suitable for further modelling, analysing and implementing suitable mitigation measures. On the other hand, timely monitoring of active landslides could provide priceless insights which can be sufficient for reducing damages. Therefore, in this work popular methods are discussed that use remotely-sensed datasets with a particular focus on the implementation of machine learning into landslide detection, susceptibility modelling and its implementation in early-warning systems. Moreover, it is reviewed how Citizen Science is adopted by scholars for providing valuable landslide-specific information, as well as couple of well-known platforms for Volunteered Geographic Information which have the potential to contribute and be used also in the landslide studies. In addition to proving an overview of the most popular techniques, this paper aims to highlight the importance of implementing interdisciplinary approaches.",

    "abstract": "In fire adapted forests, three dimensional structural characteristics are critical factors in drought and fire resilience.  Public point cloud repositories such as the USGS 3DEP program, Opentopography.org, and in the future the Earth Archive, are critical data infrastructure for climate adaptation planning. As we collectively face escalating climate hazards, the value in deploying operational geospatial tools for managing risk grows.  Historical forest management in the Western United States has resulted in declining resilience. To stabilize above ground carbon pools and secure critical ecosystem services, the State of California and the US Forest Service have committed to treating 400,000 hectares of forest per year through 2030.  These typically involve strategic mechanical thinning coupled with application of beneficial low to moderate intensity fire.  These programs are often planned and implemented through shared stewardship agreements between government agencies and implementation partners from nongovernmental organizations, First Nations governments, and local jurisdictions.  Large government land managers and industrial forest operators have typically used commercial enterprise geospatial software for data driven decision support.  Software licensing restrictions create arbitrary barriers between partners.  The proliferation of nontraditional climate planners and the need for long term reproducible data science products have created an important opportunity for the FOSS4G community. The California Forest Lidar Collaborative has been providing technical support and training to a diverse user community to apply point cloud analytics to a broad range of forestry problems. This program has facilitated the adoption of data science pipelines using Python, R, PDAL, GDAL, GRASS, and QGIS. This results in transparent environmental compliance processes, democratization of climate adaptation planning, reproducible forest data science workflows and increased diffusion of best-in-class geospatial tools.",

Dynamic graphs have been added, and some advanced features like : \r\n- create scenarii on Energy equipment ( e.g. build a methanizer )\r\n- impact of decisions on local employment\r\n\r\nTerristory is based on OpenSource software : PostGIS, Python, OpenLayers, Vector tiles… The full code for the Terristory platform itself is opensource and will be published publicly in 2021.\r\n\r\nTerristory was initially funded by a single actor and deployed in a single region. In 2020, the project accelerated : it evolved into a consortium to support the platform and deploy it in other regions. This evolution made Terristory a national project, and a reference platform for energy data visualization. This mutation is interesting on multiple levels, as it is totally coherent with an opensource project : \r\n- from a simple project to a full platform\r\n- from a single developer from a single company to multiple developers from various origins\r\n- from a single funder to multiple funders organized as a consortium\r\n- from a single actor for roadmap definition to a mutualized roadmap\r\n\r\nThis transformation makes the project's history and experience unique. The battle for climate is open, and platforms such as Terristory have a strong role to play. It should be an inspiration for any project oriented towards opensource, opendata and resource mutualization.",

    "speakers": "Massimiliano Cannata",
    "abstract": "Lakes ecosystems are exposed to growing threats due to climate change and other anthropic pressures. For example, water warming is predicted to favour harmful algal blooms (HABs) that are toxic to peoples and animals. In addition, warming tends to increase the thermal stratification of lakes and reduce turnovers, which can lead to oxygen depletion in deep layers and release of toxic gases (methane, hydrogen sulphide) from sediments. Similarly, the increased use of plastics has produced nano- and micro-plastics pollution which, together with anthropogenic micropollutants, is posing a new emerging risk factor to lake biota.\r\nTo effectively study and manage those issues, researchers and managers need monitoring data (observations) to derive effective data-driven management policies. Observations have traditionally been collected from limnological vessels through periodic (often monthly) monitoring campaigns, during which water samples are collected for further analyses in the laboratory and various measurements are performed using on-board instruments (e.g. CTD sonde measuring Conductivity, temperature and Depth or Secchi disk to observe turbidity). However, environmental issues including HABs and changes in lake stratification due to warming, call for a shift towards monitoring approaches that allows higher-frequency (e.g. hourly od daily) automatic collection of key water-quality properties (e.g. phytoplankton concentration, temperature, dissolved oxygen). Therefore, to match current challenges, leverage better phenomena understanding and activate proactive measures, monitoring systems have to be updated to provide a better temporal and spatial resolution. At the same time, this development should not increase the costs of monitoring, which are often a limiting factor in lake management.",

Commercial, affordable SAR constellations will result in the decentralization of  Earth observation, improving natural catastrophe responsiveness, resilience, and broader community engagement. SAR sensors, with the ability to observe the Earth in ways entirely inaccessible by optical and infrared sensors, present a unique capacity to quantify catastrophic impact and plan for future improvement. But SAR imagery alone is not enough: the high resolution, coherence, and frequency of revisit are only as good as the tooling shared to facilitate insights and actions. Many tools are currently available, but can also be a challenge to scale with modern cloud resources as they are often developed by scientists for scientists or locked in classified government environments. What types of open source tools are required for sustainable solution development with SAR and how can we improve existing open source contributions as we exponentially collect imagery? How can we liberate knowledge often owned only by SAR experts? In this talk, we will discuss natural catastrophe solution development at ICEYE with high temporal and spatial resolution SAR and how we overcome the challenges through partnerships such as with ESA Phi-Lab and the ESA Third Party Mission (TPM) program.",

During emergency operations, GIS and Image Intelligence significantly contribute to lifesaving operations, whether search and rescue or any other emergency operations. Having this ability, GIS has proven to minimize the cost of operations, assist in lifesaving activities, provide a common understanding of the situation through visual information of the areas of interest. \r\nUN has been utilizing geospatial technology over the past few decades and its GIS infrastructure has been built on mostly proprietary solutions. For the past years, hybrid and open-source technology have grown and matured beyond what just proprietary solutions can provide. \r\nContinuing provision of GIS services only on proprietary solution brings considerable challenges, such as limited flexibility, restrictions in data formats, high cost of licenses, limited options for scalability and mainstream, and difficulty to transfer capacity & technology to the Member States (host nations) and working partners.\r\nWhere hybrid and open-source complement to effectively support UN operational and technical demands, it is complementing UN legacy GIS infrastructure, it minimizes the cost of licenses, which would optimize the cost of running and maintaining of GIS infrastructure. The hybrid and open source technology provides flexibility and streamlining of GIS process, scalability due to cost efficiency, interoperability, innovations, and has a lighter footprint on the infrastructure.\r\nHybrid GIS architecture combines the necessary components and technical demand from both proprietary and open-source solutions through the integration of a geospatial database between a proprietary and open-source that complements both platforms to support every UN requirement. \r\nThe Hybrid GIS Infrastructure pilot project focused on proofing the concept through the design and implementation of a hybrid prototype to support (1) Unite Map and (2) Open GeoPortal.\r\nThis talk will share the experience of integration of proprietary and open-source GIS Infrastructure.",

    "abstract": "This talk presents an implementation case study for a specialist Earth Observation (EO) data processing pipeline and access portal for the UK Government, using open standards and open source tools. Details of the requirements, the technical solution and lessons learned are presented. The UK Government Department for Environment Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) is responsible for safeguarding the natural environment, supporting the UK food/farming sectors, and promoting rural economy. Defra and its agencies makes use of large volumes of geospatial data and increasingly required EO Analysis Ready Data (ARD) for a variety of applications. Defra estimated that 70% of the cost of using EO data was in the initial, often duplicated, effort of obtaining and processing data into an ARD format. Therefore, Defra adopted a 'Process Once, Use Everywhere' strategy. CGI, in partnership with Defra, delivered a solution to automatically generate and share access to ARDs openly to all Defra users, based on an open source stack. The processing pipeline was based on ARCSI and Snap, whereas the access web portal was built using GeoNode (backed by GeoServer and PostgreSQL), which exposed a variety of the standard OGC-services for downstream applications, all hosted in Microsoft Azure.\r\n\r\nThe talk illustrates a number of features to support better access that were added to the core components, demonstrating the extensibility of open source software:\r\n* Developed additional GeoNode catalogue filters, eg search by user-defined geometry.\r\n* Extended the GeoNode api to improve generating cloud-free mosaic imagery by eliminating problematic split sentinel-2 granules.\r\n* Developed a python wrapper client for the existing OGC WPS to improve automated processing workflows.\r\n* Exposing the GeoServer layergroup type to allow users to combine data easily via the GeoNode portal and via a rest API.\r\n\r\nThis implementation demonstrates that open source software such as GeoNode provides a robust and reliable choice for spatial content management. The FOSS architecture together with the partnership of CGI and Defra’s EO subject matter expert, JNCC actively contributed to the success of the implementation.\r\n\r\nThis talk discusses the need for further work by the EO software community to better support sustainability efforts:\r\n* Standardisation of an EO ARD data format and provide guidance on data types such as Cloud Optimised GeoTiff and/or the Open Data cube.\r\n* Promote the adoption of the STAC catalogue standard by developing translators for legacy EO catalogues to STAC.

    "abstract": "Bayer Crop Science recently unified internal imagery platform capabilities by completing a full re-write of core imagery APIs to leverage the performance gains offered by Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs) with the efficiencies and extensibility of the SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC). By standardizing imagery pipeline outputs on COGs, all developers and imagery scientists at Bayer Crop Science have access to the full spatial imagery catalog as STAC Item/Asset records and can implement common file access patterns.  One potential benefit of adopting STAC-accessible COGs as a standard pipeline output is the ability to squeeze out unnecessary data transfers for local writes and reads of unwanted peripheral pixels at-scale for imagery-based ML training and processing. To do this, our imagery team developed a new pilot Imagery-as-Array API to return band-specific AOI targeted range-and-column pixels as numPy arrays for processing and analysis. By implementing data transfers, reads, and writes for only targeted pixels, the resulting milliseconds saved here and there for 1000’s of images can add up to hours of unrealized network and compute time in very short order and lead to faster iterations of higher quality. The overall re-write effort aligned with Bayer global digital transformation objectives and firmly established the imagery platform as a scalable and durable pivot between imagery capture, post-processing, and decision-science based analytics to help drive future research and commercial advancements. This presentation will provide an overview of the Bayer Crop Science imagery ecosystem and the incremental efficiencies gained from integrating COGs with other open source software capabilities.",

    "speakers": "Luis Calisto",
    "abstract": "As the FOSS community grows, the number of packages we can use when creating modern web apps also grows. This is true also for spatial related packages, however this richness comes with its own difficulties: the way coordinate systems are managed is not necessarily consistent among software packages. When creating complex spatial web-based apps, we may encounter difficulties dealing with coordinates while using different packages. Developers may become aware of this problem when converting coordinates between reference systems.\r\n \r\nFor some time, developers at Sterblue faced several coordinate transformation issues while creating its comprehensive web platform. Sterblue platform is a central platform for infrastructure inspections that uses many different packages and technologies. The main programming languages are Javascript and Typescript.  \r\n \r\nInitially PROJ4JS was the preferred package to handle coordinate transformations but problems started to arise when performing format and coordinate transformations using different altitude systems. The problems became worse with the need of using local and geospatial coordinate systems.\r\n \r\nLocal coordinate systems describe a local coordinate space and are mainly used on computer graphics, for example when modelling a wind turbine 3d model. Local coordinates are not geospatial systems but their coordinates can be transformed into geospatial coordinates, for example while transforming points from a wind turbine 3d model into a geospatial coordinate system, e.g., WGS84.\r\n \r\nTo overcome this, we developed a tool that can handle multiple format and coordinate transformations as well as local coordinate system support. We named this package Geometry Referential and we provide it as FOSS. \r\n \r\nThis package was created to provide a universal way of converting coordinates between systems, formats and altitude all in the same package using one standard way. To convert coordinates between geospatial coordinate systems, it uses PROJ4JS internally, the aim is not to replace PROJ4JS but instead to extend its functionality with format; altitude and local systems conversion, all at once.\r\n \r\nThis presentation will describe what Geometry Referential is and how it can be used.",

    "abstract": "For a few years, more and more open geospatial datasets have been released regarding aerial and satellite imagery. In parallel, a wide range of geospatial tools and softwares emerged in order to exploit this amount of data, in particular through image semantic segmentation. This kind of tools are based on Artificial Intelligence techniques, especially convolutional neural networks.\r\n\r\nAt Oslandia, we proposed Deeposlandia [1] to address such a point. By considering a set of (high-resolution) images, one may easily know the composition of the image at the pixel level. This opens the door for use cases like building footprint recognition, as an example.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will depict how to go further and bridge the gap between AI-related softwares and QGIS. Our main focus will be to introduce QDeepLandia [2], a QGIS plugin that aims at providing basic semantic segmentation features for GIS users. AI techniques are composed of two different steps: a long resource-intensive training step and a quicker inference steps. While the former does not aim at figuring into a desktop application like QGIS (a huge amount of involved images, specific GPU resources), the latter suits the needs of users who want to analyze rasters and produce vectorized segmentation results on-the-fly.\r\n\r\nHence after presenting some considerations about state-of-the-art regarding semantic segmentation facilities in QGIS, the presentation will focus on the technical locks which must be overcome in terms of dependency management and packaging. Finally a presentation of Deeposlandia and QDeepLandia will be done.\r\n\r\n[1] https://gitlab.com/Oslandia/deeposlandia\r\n[2] https://gitlab.com/Oslandia/qgis/QDeeplandia",

    "speakers": "Isam Al Jawarneh",
    "abstract": "Recent research is focusing extensively on building Cloud based open source solutions for big geospatial data analytics in the Cloud. Avalanches of georeferenced mobility and micro blogging data are being collected and processed daily. However, mobility data alone is not enough to unleash the opportunities for insightful analytics that may assist in mitigating the adverse effects of climate change. For example, answering complex queries such as follows 'what are the Top-3 neighbourhoods in Buenos Aires in Argentina in terms of vehicle mobility where the index of Particulate Matters PM10 is greater than 80. Similar queries are necessary for emergent health aware smart city policies. For example, they can provide insights to municipality administrators so that they foster the design of future city infrastructure plans that feature citizen health as a priority. For example, by restricting the number of vehicles accessing highly polluted areas of the city during peak hours. Also, such information can be used to build mobile interactive maps for daily dwellers so that to inform them which routes to avoid passing-through during specific hours of a day to avoid being subjected to high-levels of vehicle-caused air-borne pollutants such as PM10. However, answering such a query would require joining real-time mobility and meteorological data. Stock versions of the current Cloud-based open-source geospatial management systems do not include intrinsic solutions for such scenarios. Future research efforts should consider developing Cloud-based open-source geospatial solutions that foster a streamlined integration with other data sources. In this talk we will show case some of the few available Cloud-based big spatial data management frameworks and how they can be utilized as springboards for further development so that they become mature enough to support the decisions that aim to mitigate the mobility-caused climate change problems. We will walkthrough an example that shows how we could tweak an open-source geospatial framework for answering such multi-domain queries. We will conclude the talk with short discussion of open research frontiers in this direction. For example, since the data that need to be collected is massive and sometimes may exceed the processing and storage capacities, there would be a need for efficient spatial- and climatologically-aware approximate techniques for compressing and summarizing the data, probably before even reaching the Cloud-based deployment (by utilizing Fog and Edge computing).",

Much conflict-induced urban damage mapping involves a before/after change mapping approach through expert visual interpretation or machine learning classification of very high resolution commercial imagery. These ad hoc analyses tend to be localized to a single city, are intended for acute detection rather than continuous monitoring of damage, and have limited means for independent validation. By comparison, open EO data have untapped potential for long-term, systematic monitoring of locations, patterns, and trends of urban damage across broad conflict regions. This talk presents the results of a purely EO-driven conflict damage monitoring framework applied to major cities affected by Syrian and Yemeni civil wars. In presenting never-before-mapped patterns and sequences of urban conflict damage, this talk highlights the need for broader uptake of open EO data in urban damage mapping.",

    "abstract": "When COVID was reported in Kenya, many organizations retreated from field surveys in informal settlements and embraced online data collection for fear of COVID in slums. They overlooked the community – eager for work and skilled in data collection - who could have collected that data. Online surveys missed target populations and inaccurately depicted what was happening.\r\n\r\nCOVID-19 hit hard in informal settlements. We lost our jobs and businesses shrank. For most families eating was a problem, let alone affording phone credit to answer an online survey. People in dire need did not have phones or sometimes electricity. Almost immediately, crime increased, mob justice increased, and several people were killed. For these reasons, our communities were not well represented in the data reported during COVID.\r\n\r\nAs a community-based data collector, I knew this wasn’t right. Here were big NGOs, many employing educated Westerners, protecting themselves at our expense in the name of poverty alleviation and justice. How could they not see the irony, and even hypocrisy? As lockdowns and curfews were announced, I wondered why none of the organizations that had trained and hired me as a data collector over the last decade had contacted me. Community-based data collectors were ideally placed to collect information about the rapidly changing situation in informal settlements.\r\n\r\nCOVID was my catalyst to form Community Mappers in early 2020, a community-based data collection organization. We identify community data priorities, train and hire community data collectors, and conduct household surveys, focus group discussions, and collect other types of data.

    "abstract": "Automated methods for capturing land use information remotely have and will likely always have fundamental limitations – pixel values alone do not capture local knowledge such as farming techniques, the location of sacred sites, or the fuzzy boundaries of a hunting area. This means that there is currently a lack of  collective knowledge and open data and information availability about human-land interactions, which poses an obstacle for building complete local and planetary-scale environmental management systems that could contribute to ensuring sustainable development by tackling the two interconnected problems of climate change and rural poverty. Developing a better understanding of how humans use land – to encourage sustainability – requires integrating the knowledge that land users hold into the mapping process. However, the democratisation of geographic data use and production which make this possible is not yet a reality, especially in rural areas – often, land is not mapped by those who use it.\r\n\r\nTaking an interdisciplinary approach, this research explores how inequality in participation in geographic data production and use can be reduced. Two recent geographic citizen science pilot projects in South West Nigeria and Kenya where few small communities of farmers and herders are creating digital land use maps will be presented, focusing on the co-designed prototypes – using Sapelli and web technologies – for satellite imagery-based off-site mapping and/or GNSS-based on-site mapping. Lessons learned about map semantics, the universality-customisation dilemma and the scalability challenge will be briefly discussed, with special attention to the role that popular messaging apps and their design and infrastructure can play in enhancing instant land-related knowledge sharing while also appropriately stimulating the creation of land user-generated land use maps.

A lot of those maps are being used to support situational awareness assessments. However, typically, open EO imagery works well over open water rural areas but in areas where most people and assets at risk are located, i.e. urban areas, traditional flood mapping algorithms applied to free satellite data have serious limitations. However, recently, advances in using SAR signal coherence change for mapping floods coupled with an increase in powerful cloud computing, make urban flood mapping a reality. In this talk, we present examples of use cases using an urban flood map algorithm on an online cloud-based EO processing platform to rapidly process Sentinel-1 SAR images into urban building geometries that are then used to derive an accurate urban flood map using SAR signal coherence change.",

    "speakers": "Peter Mooney",
    "abstract": "The COVID-9 pandemic has been a massive challenge for all of society. Within education the institutional response to the pandemic has been crucial to how education continues to function and deliver the highest quality teaching and learning opportunities for all students. For everyone, teachers and students, working from home far away from the high quality facilities of our universities, colleges and schools is one of the major challenges. In this talk I reflect on the last 18 months of teaching and learning within the University environment and how Free and Open Source Software For Geomatics (FOSS4G) has responded to the many challenges of this 'new normal' in education. In particular, I recount my experiences of teaching subjects such as Spatial Databases, Web-based Mapping and Mobile Application Development whilst also supervising student-led projects at both undergraduate and postgraduate level all of which involve the use of FOSS4G and Open Data. With my talk I shall outline where FOSS4G delivered major advantages in the fully online teaching environment including:\r\n* A community of technical and educational support available around the world. This was particularly important as many students were studying at home in their home country and not easily able to access institutional support. The international community of FOSS4G allowed students to access technical help and support in their native language.\r\n* Portability and compatibility with a very wide range of computers, laptops and devices. Away from the homogeneous computing environment offered by university or school computing laboratories students used a wide variety of devices and FOSS4G software was available for practically all of these.\r\n* Offering a FOSS4G and Open Data approach in classes means we avoid any messy issues around licenses and contracts. Students have enough issues to deal with without software and data adding to their daily stress.\r\n* Many students reported needing to use different computers or devices depending on availability in their household which consequently meant installation of software for their study on each device.\r\n\r\nI believe that many of the arrangements put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic will become integrated into future teaching and learning practice. Over the last 18 months the loss of one-to-one tuition and classroom based teaching has been monumental. As I will detail carefully in my presentation, during this time, FOSS4G has further embellished its reputation to become a critical component of technology-based learning in the future.",

This shift is fueled by developments in the open source software community. The open source ecosystem now supports and deeply influences how science is accomplished and thought about. Advanced open source software tools are enabling new data formats that are optimized for cloud storage enabling rapid analysis of multi-petabyte datasets. Open source cloud-based data science platforms, accessed through a web-browser window, are enabling advanced, collaborative, interdisciplinary science to be performed wherever scientists can connect to the internet. Increasing amounts of data and computational power in the cloud are unlocking new approaches for data-driven discovery. For the first time, it is truly feasible for geospatial and other scientists to bring their analysis to the data without specialized cloud computing knowledge. Practically, for scientists, the effect of these changes is to vastly shrink the amount of time spent acquiring and processing data, freeing up more time for science. This shift in paradigm is lowering the threshold for entry, expanding the science community, and increasing opportunities for collaboration, while promoting scientific innovation, transparency, and reproducibility.

    "abstract": "The snow and glaciers in the Himalayan region are very sensitive to the climate change. The cause of the climate change is the long-range transport of dust and outflow of the anthropogenic emissions from the Indo-Gangetic Plains that reach over the Himalayan region. In the last three decades, the population in the Indo-Gangetic Plains have increased that resulted greenhouse emissions over the Himalayan region. The aerosol concentrations have enhanced the melting of snow/glaciers over the Himalayan region. Further, the biomass burning in the Himalayan region is routinely done by the people living in the region, and frequency of forest fires in the lower Himalaya is increasing due to climate change. The satellite data have shown the reduction of spectral reflectance and corresponding changes in backscattering and brightness temperature, that show the dynamic changes in the surface, thickness of the snow/glaciers and characteristics. Further, the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) provide information about the meteorological parameters at the surface and at different pressure levels. Efforts are being made to launch several satellite missions with high spatial and temporal resolutions. The deadly, Chamoli disaster of 7 February 2021 in the Himalaya, is an eye opening for all of us. In this talk, an integrated approach to combine seismic, geophysical and multi satellite optical and microwave data to study the dynamic nature and to get an early signal about changes in surface, snow and glaciers covers that will help us to evaluate the risk of snow avalanches, rockslides, landslides and glacial lake outburst flood (GOLF) in the Himalayan region which will help us to avoid loss of lives.",

It will provide a series of examples of current efforts and practices, highlight some of the new data sources being leveraged, including new satellite-based settlement and population layers, and elaborate on ongoing attempts to provide more routine, low-cost data collection in sometimes difficult, generally not well connected environments as well as detailed examples of current ongoing efforts of Bluesquare in countries such as DRC and Niger ([Carte Sanitaire](https://www.cartesanitaireniger.org/)).\r\n\r\nAs data governance, sharing and opening are recurring issues in many countries, Bluesquare also works with public administrations on sharing and opening their data. This goes from providing web interfaces from where data can directly be downloaded to a dedicated data sharing and analysis platform, allowing controlled access in the context of more limited sharing agreements.\r\n\r\nThe author will also briefly showcase two free software products: its geo-aware data collection, curation and analysis platform, [Iaso](https://github.com/BLSQ/iaso), presented in detail in another proposed talk, and the soon to be released OpenHexa, which offers administrations the possibility to share data with researchers or other interested parties, and to explore, analyse and visualize this data. The main aim will be to show how these tools fit into the larger picture of geographic data creation and curation in the health sector in developing countries.",

But there are still significant barriers in accessing and using Earth Observation data operationally, especially in countries with limited resources - which are also the most affected by climate change. To help overcome some of these challenges, the UN World Food Program has developed an open source software solution called PRISM, which simplifies the process for creating an interactive web-based mapping application built on React that can visualize and analyze climate hazard data published through OGC standard web services. During this talk, we’ll present the problem we aimed to solve, the technology choices we’ve made, and our rationale for opting to go open source for this solution.",

    "speakers": "Robin Wilson",
    "abstract": "You’ve almost certainly used the PDF format to store a map visualisation before - but did you know that PDFs aren’t restricted to static data? Using Geospatial PDFs you can build interactive PDFs in which layers can be switched on and off, data and locations can be queried, and data can even be re-loaded back into a GIS system. And you don’t need fancy software to create these PDFs: it can be done with QGIS and GDAL.\r\n\r\nThis talk will start with the basics of exporting a Geospatial PDF from QGIS, and demonstrate what can be done with the resulting PDF. I will then show how nicely styled Geospatial PDFs can be created in GDAL using a XML configuration file (yes, GDAL can do vector styling!). Finally, I will show just how far you can take this...creating a fully-interactive, animated geospatial data display application in a PDF file (yes, really - it sounds crazy, and it probably is a bit crazy, but it works!).\r\n\r\nThis particular application allows visualisation of shipping tracks alongside ancillary data, and the interactivity allows you to show and hide layers, jump to specific times, step through time and produce an animation of the ship’s track. Of course, being a PDF, this can be shared as a single file, easily printed at any stage, and doesn’t require the installation of specific GIS software. This is implemented through the magic of Python, GDAL and the PDF Javascript API. This final output can be created entirely using open-source software, but does require the proprietary Adobe Reader software to work to its full extent - although most Geospatial PDFs can be used with a range of PDF reader applications.\r\n\r\nOpen-source code samples will be provided alongside the presentation, and the presentation will include interactive demonstration of the created PDFs. The presentation is likely to appeal to users of all experience levels, and may introduce even expert users to possibilities they had never considered!",

    "speakers": "Dewey Dunnington",
    "abstract": "Whereas many vector processing algorithms require coordinates to be in projected coordinates, processing algorithms are often needed, or simply more convenient, in a global context. Several open source projects currently compute for instance areas from ellipsoidal coordinates by simply assuming they are Cartesian, resulting in meaningless (\"squared degree\") quantities, without warning. Google's open source S2 Geometry library provides data structures and algorithms for manipulating vector geometry on the sphere; however, its use in open-source GIS software is limited. In addition to most simple feature access operators, S2 Geometry allows for \"semi-open\" polygons, which uniquely assigns points on boundaries of two touching polygons to a single polygon. This is a welcome addition to DE-9IM for the common case where sets of polygons represent a coverage. In 2020 we created a set of bindings for S2 Geometry in R to add sphere-native capabilities to the sf package, whose functions were previously powered by GEOS for both projected and spherical coordinates. Our bindings reconciled a number of differences between S2 Geometry's C++ API and GEOS' C API that were needed for a seamless transition for users of sf. In addition to eliminating the need for projected coordinates for many vector processing applications, benchmarking suggests that predicates and overlay computations using S2 are as fast as or faster than those based on 2D projected coordinates. It is planned that these bindings become the default when coordinates are ellipsoidal. Collectively, we see a bright future for S2 in the R language and the greater free and open-source geospatial community.",

With the rapid urbanization going on in the city, it shows that this problem will get worse in the years ahead. The scale of the problem is huge (over 1 billion people do not have land rights), not only in Tanzania but also in the world at large. \r\n\r\nThe cost of surveying plots and providing title deeds is prohibitive using conventional methods, but using community mapping, OpenStreetMap, and cheap dual-frequency sensors it is possible. Our solution is simple: **community cadastres.** Working with small communities (100-200 people), and using low-cost, high-accuracy, dual-frequency Real-Time Kinematics, we can create incredibly precise maps that lead to title deeds. \r\n\r\nI will share the story of using this technology in one subward in Dar es Salaam, and how we used both OpenStreetMap and open-source tools such as QGIS, to make the community cadastres part of the map that leads to land rights.",

Communities around the globe have varying levels of adaptive capacity and generally only the largest have the financial resources, human capital and political will to respond fully. For most, feasible solutions are hard to find and evaluate, and the funds required to implement them are beyond reach. What those communities need is skilled people that can interpret climate data, decision-ready analytics,  and available resources to help them take on-the-ground action--unfortunately that type of work doesn’t happen in any public repo or open data lake. \r\n\r\nThe White House is making addressing climate change equitably one of its highest priorities, as evidenced by the January 27th Executive Order (14008). In response, NOAA will be leading the charge to train a vast workforce to leverage existing climate data and tools--growing the community of resilience professionals to accelerate community action. In this session, I hope to challenge you to think about ways you can ally yourself with those closer to the action-- those making decisions about how to protect our people, property, and cultures for the next generation.

But to enable transparency, reproducibility and accessibility of used methods, we want to be able to calculate slopes using free and open source software.\r\nWe developed an R package - **slopes** - due prior experience with the language and the mature 'R-spatial' community which has developed mature codebases for working with geographic data in a reproducible command line environment, including `sf` (for working with vector datasets representing roads and other linear features) and `raster` (for representing digital elevation models, DEMs).\r\n\r\nBuilding on these foundations the slopes package is now working and has been used to calculate slopes on thousand of roads in several cities across the globe, as long as it has elevation data to work with. \r\nComparison with ArcMap's 3D analyst show that the approach is competitive with the go-to proprietary produce in terms of computational speed and that we can reproduce ArcMap's results: tests show an R-squared value of 0.977.\r\nWe hope the package will be of use and interest to the FOSS4G and in the talk will discuss ideas for taking the work forward, e.g. by implementing the logic into other languages/environments such as Rust, Python and even as a QGIS plugin.\r\nCould there be scope for an inter-disciplinary and language-agnostic community interested in slope analysis?\r\nWe would like support efforts to strengthen links between geospatial developers who use R and the wider FOSS4G community, for example by comparing the slopes package with other open source approaches for slope calculation and analysis for mutually beneficial learning.\r\nWe will conclude with discussion of possible future directions of travel for the project, including possibilities for 3D visualisation, auto-download of elevation point data sampled across linear features (currently the package automates the download of DEM data but requires a MapBox API key) and using the slope values to enter as a variable in route choice algorithms in route networks, as well as generate evidence in support of sustainable transport policies.",

This issue has been addressed using a combination of exact arithmetics for robustness and floating-point filters to mitigate the computational cost of exact computations.\r\nThe implementation of exact computations and floating-point filters can be a difficult task, and code generation tools have been proposed to address this. We present a new C++ meta-programming framework for the generation of fast, robust predicates for arbitrary geometric predicates based on polynomial expressions. We show examples of how this approach produces correct results for GIS data sets that could lead to incorrect predicate results for naive implementations.

    "abstract": "Seagrasses are one of the world’s most productive ecosystems, playing an important role in climate change mitigation and adaptation. They are vast natural carbon sinks which have important yet underestimated implications into national climate agendas. Precise knowledge of seagrass distribution and site-specific in-situ carbon data is crucial for global seagrass carbon storage, but is limited to a few well-studied sites. Within the context of the Global Seagrass Watch project, funded by DLR and supported by the GEO-GEE program, we aim to develop open country-scale seagrass maps and related carbon stocks in support of the Nationally Determined Contributions of the Paris Agreement. We process open Sentinel-2 multi-temporal data within the open cloud computing platform of the Google Earth Engine to quantify seagrass and associated carbon stocks. Our generated data inventories will support interdisciplinary scientific research and management efforts within a regional and global climate action context.",

SONAR suffers from the same challenges of scale, datasets split across thousands of files, and inability to quickly manipulate data. And yet, SONAR is one of the most interesting point cloud data types that should be analyzed at cloud scale, from finding shipwrecks to knowing whether a vessel is going to block the Suez Canal. This is where TileDB Embedded can help as an open-source library and cloud-native data engine for working with large multi-dimensional arrays.\r\n\r\nTileDB Embedded can help accelerate SONAR analysis workflows in several ways. First, I will cover how analysis-ready TileDB arrays of many TBs can be sliced directly from cloud object storage in seconds, returning dataframes that are easily accessible from Pandas in Jupyter notebooks. Next, I will present TileDB integrations with familiar SONAR and point cloud tools like MB-System and PDAL, and how TileDB can help apply this information with modern data science techniques.\r\n\r\nFinally, I will show real use-cases of TileDB with SONAR point clouds. With TileDB, you can avoid downloading full datasets and working across several domain-specific libraries. TileDB allows you to efficiently extract specific features and points of interest. The talk will conclude by addressing these challenges with a demo of subsea point cloud analysis.",

Preparation of data for multitemporal analysis is made possible in the t.sentinel and t.rast.mosaic extensions by automatic creation of space time raster datasets (strds) and temporal aggregation to achieve up to cloud-free temporal mosaics. Furthermore, a dedicated add-on based on ESA’s SNAP software handles Sentinel-1 SAR data preprocessing (radiometric calibration, speckle-filtering, geometric terrain-correction) and import. In all add-ons, effort is put in parallelization wherever possible to speed up the processing times of heavyweight Earth Observation data. This toolset allows the use of the entire range of GRASS GIS functionality for image analysis in various applications.

    "speakers": "Natalia Cárdenas Niño",
    "abstract": "The WAPLUGIN is a tool created on the open-source software QGIS for the computation of water accounting and crop water productivity indicators based on WaPOR data, the open-access remote sensing database from FAO. The plugin creates a bridge between WaPOR information and QGIS and offers some tools to process and calculate the indicators, such as the overall consumed ratio, the depleted fraction, the overall field application ratio, among others. Most of these water accounting and productivity indicators reflect the impact that agriculture has on water resources. Hence, their analysis will help identify specific issues that can be addressed by policymakers, large scheme irrigation managers, river basin authorities, water professionals, among others. \r\n\r\nIt is possible to access the WAPLUGIN as any other QGIS plugin. Moreover, it has two main features: the \"WaPOR Catalog\" and the \"Indicator Calculator\". On the one hand, the first feature has the capacity to bring data from WaPOR to QGIS, providing direct access to the full catalogue, and the selection will depend on the user specifications (date, location, parameter, resolution). The selected map data will then appear on the canvas as a raster layer. On the other hand, the plugin's second feature offers the possibility of calculating some of the essential water accounting and productivity indicators based on WaPOR data. As in the first feature, the user has to specify the primary data like date, location, resolution and units. Depending on the indicator, the input data can also include information provided by the user, apart from the WaPOR data. Finally, the resulting indicator map will be added as a raster layer in the QGIS canvas, facilitating access to WaPOR data for QGIS users and providing good compatibility with the QGIS tools for further processing. \r\n\r\nThe WAPLUGIN is an innovative tool, due to it facilitating water accounting and productivity analysis, by bringing together two powerful open-source platforms for the water and remote sensing community. The plugin reduces the time consuming and enables the easy access and processing of WaPOR data, making this less time consuming for GIS analysts. Furthermore, the indicators will support users by generating maps and reports for further assessment and evaluation, identifying the places of high and low irrigation efficiency and the crop and water productivity behaviour.",

    "abstract": "The generation and consumption of spatial information in the hydrographic field is a fundamental part of daily work, as not only are many decisions taken based on this information but, additionally, information is produced in real time based on these decisions and processes.\r\nAnother of the particular characteristics of hydrographic information is the great amount of detail and its size, which traditionally makes it necessary to use desktop tools for the execution of geoprocesses and the production of derived information.\r\n\r\nIn this context, the use and edition of information through web clients using OGC processes and standards (WMS, WMST, WPS), solves the casuistry and provides the necessary power for daily work, focused on an architecture where the server centralises operations and processes. \r\n\r\nHowever, the irruption of new technologies with the use of vector tiles presented as an evolutionary leap presents great advantages in the management of data at both server and client level. At the server side, it allows for lighter and more resilient infrastructures through the use of STAC and enables the process load to be distributed while at client level, it provides the browsers with the vector data for the execution of geoprocesses locally using specific tools.\r\n\r\nThis use case presents a practical application for the production and customisation of vector tiles in the specific case of hydrological information, presenting an application where, on the one hand, spatial information is integrated into the data production processes by generating the appropriate services and, on the other hand, client tools are used for the management, geoprocessing and consolidation of spatial information using vector tiles.\r\n\r\nAdditionaly, the information in vector tile format has specific styles, developed using a tool that manages the spatial information in vector format and establishes an associated style through a simple user interface. Thus, the viewer requests the vector information and the associated style for its adequate rendering to the user.\r\nThis environment has been based on Open Source technologies and standards, which allows its scalability and sustainability in the future in a modular way.\r\n\r\nFinally, it is worth highlighting the good performance obtained, as the project, through the interfaces developed, achieves both the updating of spatial information in an integrated way in the production and decision-making processes, as well as its dissemination in different formats.\r\n\r\nTechnologies: PostGIS, GeoServer, Maputnik, OpenLayers, Mapea, vector tiles, STAC",

It aims to create a pan-European Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) to support European Union (EU) environmental policies and the European Green Deal data space, setting requirements on the provision of metadata, harmonised datasets and services (to discover, view and download data). Technical requirements for INSPIRE implementation are based on open standards, mainly from ISO and the OGC. The Joint Research Centre of the European Commission is the INSPIRE technical coordinator and supports its implementation by developing and operating so-called INSPIRE central infrastructure components: the Geoportal, Reference Validator and Registry.\r\nThe INSPIRE Geoportal (https://inspire-geoportal.ec.europa.eu) is the central access point to the data made available by EU Member States under INSPIRE. It periodically harvests Member States discovery services and makes identified datasets findable, accessible and downloadable. The backend is based on Solr, while the frontend uses standard web libraries including Leaflet for managing map content; the basemap is the European Commission’s OpenStreetMap version, reflecting the EU position on disputed borders. A major work has just started to redesign the Geoportal backend using GeoNetwork.\r\nThe INSPIRE Reference Validator (https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/validator/about) is the tool used by Member States data providers to check the conformity of their resources (metadata, datasets and services) against the INSPIRE interoperability requirements. The software is an implementation of the ETF (https://etf-validator.net), an open source testing framework for SDI resources. Tests are organized into Executable Test Suites (ETS) using SoapUI, BaseX and the OGC TEAM Engine.\r\nThe INSPIRE Registry (https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/registry) is the tool managing reference codes for all the INSPIRE items, including reference documents, code lists and application schemas. It assigns identifiers to items and their labels, definitions and descriptions. There are currently 7000+ INSPIRE reference codes, available in 23 languages and served in 7 different formats (HTML, XML, ISO 19135 XML, RDF, JSON, ATOM, CSV). The INSPIRE Registry is an implementation of the open source Re3gistry software (https://github.com/ec-jrc/re3gistry), which will be included in the upcoming OSGeo Live v.14 and soon proposed as an OSGeo Community Project.\r\nThe presentation will demonstrate how these tools work, outline their potential reuse beyond INSPIRE and share lessons learnt for FOSS4G uptake by the public sector.",

Fue realizado en seis comunidades indígenas, pertenecientes al pueblo Mbya guaraní e Yshir, en el Departamento de Itapúa y Alto Paraguay, respectivamente. Se trabajó de manera participativa con las comunidades de Pastoreo , Ko’eju y Pykasu´i, Puerto Esperanza, Karcha Balhut (14 de Mayo) y Puerto Diana. En total se delimitaron y documentaron 35.828 hectáreas, donde viven aproximadamente 1.374 familias, las cuales tendrán una herramienta legal para regularizar la ocupación de sus tierras. De forma previa, se realizó una reunión con la Organización de las Naciones Unidas (ONU) y con la Federación por la Autodeterminación de los Pueblos Indígenas (FAPI), donde éstos explican la problemática y entregan los títulos de las propiedades indígenas; los títulos fueron digitalizados, junto con la propiedades aledañas a las comunidades registradas en el SNC; luego, se presentó el plan de trabajo a las comunidades en busca del visto bueno y acompañamiento de sus miembros para ingresar a medir in situ su territorio y determinar la geolocalización de los polígonos de los títulos a partir de límites físicos históricos de las comunidades Indígenas; posteriormente, se presentaron a las comunidades los resultados donde pudieron visualizar los límites reales de sus territorios, con la ubicación y contabilización de hectáreas que presentan conflicto por invasión de privados; se establecieron puntos de apoyo sobre los límites de las propiedades que fueron materializados para reforzar la delimitación existente; finalmente, con la aprobación de los líderes de cada comunidad, se confeccionaron los planos e informes a ser presentados ante Instituto Nacional del Indígena (INDI) y SNC",

From a meteorological point of view, access to standardized data across national borders would be a major accomplishment significantly simplifying use of such data in various domains (agriculture, transportation etc). The need for standardised data is even more stringent considering the large quantity of data collected by the Romanian National Meteorological Administration: 10 meteorological data sets, 31 meteorological parameters, more than 230 weather stations, and over 500000 daily records starting from 1960, some of them being updated every 6 hours. In order to efficiently store and distribute all this data while respecting the various European and global standards specific to the meteorological domain (INSPIRE, GRIB, BUFR), a full stack of open-source technologies and applications was used (PostgreSQL, PostGIS, Hale Studio, GeoServer, GeoNetwork, MapStore, GeoHealthCheck etc).\r\nFor a fully conforming INSPIRE implementation, the standardized Open Geospatial Consortium (OGS) INSPIRE services (OGS CSW discovery services, OGS WMS view services, OGS WFS download services) were used and fine-tuned to provide all necessary metadata and interlinking, in accordance with existing regulations, technical requirements and nascent best practices.\r\nTo complement these standard mapping services, a series of auxiliary tools were implemented, such as a web mapping client, a service for monitoring the INSPIRE services and a dedicated instance of the EU-wide INSPIRE validation framework.",

For a long time, NAWASCO’s field officers used old maps to monitor water connections. Having inherited customers from the Nanyuki Municipal council, they had to do an intense ground work to mark their territory. They walked around with the old maps following water pipelines between intake and the consumption points in order to identify the number of customers served under their jurisdiction.\r\nThat was cumbersome! With advancement in technology, a decision was made to digitize the system to ease the identification burden. \r\nJourney to Digitization.\r\nTo kick-off the digitization journey, QGIS a Free and Open Source Geographic Information software was used to convert old maps into computer readable documents that were used to develop the Geographic Information System. A GIS database was developed using POSTGIS where all the digitized data were stored. For analysis purposes and building a strong GIS system field data was collected using hand held GPS .These included pressure data, new connections, newly installed appurtenances and fittings.\r\nThe amount of water lost between production and billing points has been one of the major challenges faced at NAWASCO. FOSS4G applications has assisted the team to have a better understanding of network and prompt leaks and bursts repairs hence reducing non- revenue water. Nanyuki water success story of Non-Revenue water reduction from 55% to 30% is largely due to adoption of GIS technology (Free and Open Source Geographic Information software. The water utility has also improved its billing efficiency through GIS. Meter readers, billing officers, repairs and maintenance team and non-revenue water team are now able to locate customers using shared vector tiles from the [link](https://new.nawascogis.co.ke).",

    "abstract": "During the remote learning necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic, university GIS students did not always have home access to the kinds of software and hardware that they would ordinarily get in their on-campus lab facilities. In this situation, the free and cross-platform nature of FOSS opened the door for some students to continue their GIS education uninterrupted. I describe how one university allowed students to choose FOSS such as QGIS, PostGIS, and GeoDa as alternatives to proprietary software in upper-division GIS coursework. These were used to teach techniques such as point pattern analysis, visibility analysis, hydrological modeling, proximity surfaces, LISA analysis, process modeling, open data access, and data summation. I share specific software tools, commands, and plugins used to apply these techniques in lab assignments. I discuss how these approaches can form a lasting part of the GIS curriculum beyond the pandemic, and how students can position these FOSS skills as they prepare for the GIS job market.",

    "abstract": "Agriculture comprises vital economic sectors producing food, agro-industrial feedstock, and energy and provides environmental services through managing soil, water, air, and biodiversity holistically. Agriculture including forestry also contributes to managing and reducing risks from natural disasters such as floods, droughts, landslides, and avalanches. Farming with its close contact to nature provides the socio-economic infrastructure to maintain cultural heritage. Farmers are also conservers of forests, pastures, fallow lands, and their natural resources and, in turn, of the environment. Agriculture today is a composite activity involving many actors and stakeholders in agri-food chains that produce and provide food and agricultural commodities to consumers. In addition to farmers, there are farm input suppliers, processors, transporters, and market intermediaries each playing their roles to make these chains efficient.\r\nPresentation will present analysis and the the vision of the EO4Agri project about the role of Earth observations in agriculture. The increasing economic, social, and environmental needs of agriculture pose many challenges for the upcoming years. \r\nThis topic is closely related to the strategies of the United Nations and the European Union on sustainability. The United Nations adopted 17 Sustainable Development Goals in 2015 as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The European Union presented in 2019 the European Green Deal - a roadmap to make the European economy sustainable. This white paper aims to stress the importance of knowledge management for agriculture to address these challenges. The role of Earth observation in this knowledge management is analysed including its current gaps and limitations. The white paper focuses on the definition of key problems, analysis data gaps, delivery platforms, analytical platforms, and final recommendations for future policies and financing. This document serves as an input for the future Strategic Research Agenda and the Policy Roadmap.",

Fue creada en 2002 a petición de los Pueblos Indígenas Harakbut, Yine y Matsiguenka, los habitantes del territorio desde tiempos ancestrales. Actualmente el área es gestionada de manera conjunta entre las comunidades indígenas representadas por el ECA-Amarakaeri y el Servicio Nacional de Áreas Naturales Protegidas por el Estado del Perú (SERNANP). La cogestión de la Reserva Comunal Amarakaeri viene apostando por el uso  de herramientas tecnológicas para fortalecer su sistema de vigilancia y control. Entre ellas se encuentra MAPEO, un sistema gratuito de código abierto para el mapeo y monitoreo territorial. Desde 2018, los vigilantes comunales y los guardaparques del SERNANP están usando el aplicativo MAPEO Mobile en celulares smartphone para recoger información durante los patrullajes. Por otro lado, los coordinadores y equipo técnico del área de vigilancia y control usan el programa MAPEO Desktop para visualizar y analizar la información recogida y generar informes de patrullaje para uso interno en la gestión de la RCA y para compartir con entidades  externas con el objetivo de intervenir sobre las actividades ilegales encontradas. \r\nEntre las ventajas de MAPEO destacan el envío de alertas inmediatas a través de correo electrónico o Whatsapp y la inexistente necesidad de internet a la hora de usar el aplicativo y sincronizar bases de datos entre celulares y computadoras de un mismo proyecto. MAPEO permite la recogida de información geoespacial, imágenes y texto con el celular y, además, permite la personalización de las categorías, los iconos y los formularios usados para recoger información. Por último, el sistema MAPEO garantiza la soberanía de datos por parte de sus usuarios, ya que no necesita de un servidor central externo.\r\nEn esta presentación descubriremos las funciones del aplicativo MAPEO y como viene siendo aplicado por el Estado y los pueblos indígenas en la conservación de su territorio ancestral, hoy reconocido como Área Natural Protegida Reserva Comunal Amarakaeri. A través de este sistema se contribuye a la conservación y complementa la implementación de la propuesta de acción climática REDD+ Indigena Amazónica (RIA), aportando hacia las Contribuciones Nacionalmente Determinadas (NDC).",

The Jupyter solutions were applied in MAPFOR to better communicate within the research team, mainly in the development area. The second application is a framework to analyse and visualise collaborative emotional mapping data in urban mobility, where the emotions were collected and represented through emojis. The computational notebook was applied in this emotional mapping to enable the interaction of users, without a SQL background, with spatial data stored in a database through widgets to analyse and visualise emotional spatial data. We developed these different contexts in a Jupyter Notebook to practice the FAIR principles, promote the Open Science movement, and Open Geospatial Resources.

In literature there are many studies that analyzed the potential of the proliferation in function of the temperature and they showed an increasing egg mortality when temperatures are below 2° Celsius for a sufficient period of time. Although the Ae. Albopictus can potentially reach the North of the Alps exploiting the traffic crossing the country, according to predictions based on climate driven large-scale model it can proliferate in part of the Swiss Plateau and in the area of the Lake Geneva while other areas, such as Zurich and Basel, seems currently to have too cold winter seasons for the survival of the eggs.

As colonization, deforestation and acculturation creep deeper into the Indigenous ways of life in the Amazon rainforest and elsewhere, that living memory is harder and harder to transfer from generation to generation. Consequently, younger Indigenous people do not get the opportunity to develop the same intimate relationship to the territory as their elders have.\r\n\r\nTo help keep Indigenous stories and storytelling traditions alive, we developed a methodology and built an accompanying free and open-source application called Terrastories.

To overcome these challenges, I have used a combination of commercial and open-source software. incorporating a PostgreSQL/PostGIS database, and ArcGIS for viewing.  \r\n\r\nAs with any organization, needs change, and these have resulted in moving away from a focus on the desktop, to a web viewer for most GIS needs.  As it happens, this platform has its underpinnings firmly in the FOSS arena.  At the same time, the timing was right to shift my primary editing and mapping on the desktop to QGIS.  Going in the opposite direction to a degree, the need has also arisen to utilize different Esri software to support other city software needs, and thus a process has been developed to transfer data as necessary.  \r\n\r\nIn this presentation I will detail how the GIS is being restructured to serve multiple data endpoints with a minimum of duplication.  This is accomplished through a combination of the existing database, moving data to Amazon AWS, and adding some programming to tie it all together.  Through it all, the pieces that I do pay for act as a multiplier on the results I would be able to achieve by doing things myself.  In many cases, the funds are going to development of applications, or technical support, with concrete benefits, as opposed to paying for licensing.  When all is said and done, by judicious utilization of FOSS geospatial, you don't need a huge budget to have a highly flexible, expandable system to meet the needs of multiple departments, staff and software.",

Plastic pollution originates from land before it makes its way into our waters. As a result,it jeopardizes the health and subsistence of marine ecosystems through ingestion, entanglement, and chemical contamination.\r\nAccording to UNEP, the scale of plastic pollution accounts for 75 billion US dollars in social and environmental costs every year.\r\nSince then, several solutions to marine litter and microplastics have emerged. However, plastic, and especially single use plastic, continues to find its way into our oceans. Beaches and waterfronts are littered with plastic, islands of plastics can be found floating in the ocean, seas,streams,rivers,and lakes.\r\nCurrently, indeed the emphasis on plastic waste prevention represents a key principle.\r\nHowever at this stage, it will not be just a matter of containing plastic pollution from entering  waters.\r\nEnsuring proper monitoring and reporting of marine litter is essential to assess the status of coastal environments.\r\nSeveral experiences on high resolution satellite images are present in literature in order to create integrated platforms to monitor marine litter internationally .\r\nHowever, the  so called Citizen Science Approach provides  several experiences. More specifically in areas with limited data and capacity to establish comprehensive waste m monitoring programs. To employ some of the most relevant case studies, the pilot project called Closing the Loop from the UN ESCAP, or the Marine Litter Watch Month Program organized the ACT4LITTER Project in the Mediterranean sea as well as the Citizen Science Association regional platform. The collaboration with the Civil Society monitors programs and initiatives to collect relevant data to provide an opportunity, even though citizen science is coupled with Open Science, as the attitude to make scientific research and its dissemination accessible to all governmental levels.\r\nThe study explores case studies and methodologies to foster the monitoring of marine litter through citizen science approaches. More specifically, the design of the participatory data collection and mapping will be analyzed. In order to widen the possibilities of improving better knowledge of coastal debris status through the involvement of local communities. Participatory Open GIS platforms like JOSM, the Global Partnership on Marine-Litter (GPML) digital platform, and the participatory use of QGIS will be used towards better implementation of citizen science and social campaigns on marine litter data collection advocacy.",

    "abstract": "Zones are key building blocks used for analysis and creating models (mental and statistical) of urban and environmental systems.\r\nUsed in a range of fields from biodiversity assessment to transport planning, spatially contiguous areal units break-up continuous space into discrete chunks.\r\nMany methods *rely* on good zoning systems, including origin-destination analysis, geographically weighted regression, and choropleth visualisation.\r\n\r\nOpen access administrative boundaries are increasingly available through national databases and OpenStreetMap but are often inappropriate to geographic research, analysis and map making needs, being often: based on arbitrary factors; inconsistent between different cities/regions; and of highly variable sizes and shapes.\r\n\r\nThis talk outlines an approach to tackle these problems: tools that can auto-generate zones based on minimal input data.\r\nWe propose cross-platform and language agnostic implementations to enable a diverse range of people to generate bespoke zoning systems for their needs based on the understanding that accessibility, flexibility and extensibility are key to usability.\r\nWe also demonstrate working tools that take a step in this direction which at the time of writing include:\r\n\r\n-   a core library written in Rust with small and fast binaries available for all major operating systems\r\n-   an R package (published on the Comprehensive R Archive Network, CRAN) that also enables visualisation of zoning systems\r\n\r\nWe plan to create a Python Package, a QGIS plugin and web user interface based on the core library and welcome suggestions and contributions via our GitHub organization: <https://github.com/zonebuilders>.\r\nBased on the experience of developing these tools, we will discuss next steps towards accessible and flexible zone building tools and language/platform agnostic tools for geospatial work in general.\r\n\r\nWe conclude that the approach, based on low-level and easy-to-distribute tools that can be used in multiple free and open source frameworks, could be applied to other domains and help join diverse communities (e.g. based on R, Python or QGIS) through use of shared low-level, cross-platform and future-proof implementations.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe source code underlying the approach can be found at <https://github.com/zonebuilders>",

    "speakers": "Bridget Fleming",
    "abstract": "South Africa is one of only a few countries that has Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in the secondary school curriculum. Of these few, SA is even more singular as its Geography syllabus includes GIS geoprocessing. The status of GIS teaching in secondary schools is investigated with the aim to determine if the use of Open Source software and data such as QGIS and OSM would facilitate the use of GIS as a teacher intervention. The data was collected by means of an online questionnaire and a smaller sample was interviewed. Results from this study show that only a minority of teachers teach practical GIS classes irrespective of their Examination Board, access to hardware, how resourced their school is or whether they teach at a private or a government school. The key determinants to teaching practical GIS lessons are the teacher’s perceived GIS expertise and access to GIS data and time. Software, connectivity, and power supply were also identified as challenges. \r\nTeachers who participated in the study overwhelming agree that there are numerous benefits to using GIS in the classroom. They also expressed a keen willingness to attend GIS courses and learn more about FOSS4G tools. A sample group evaluated how OSM could be used to create local GIS spatial data and how QGIS can be used to teach the GIS curriculum and used to map local data for individual research projects. FOSS4G empowers teachers with the means to create exciting, real, and relevant teaching content that can be used on all platforms, especially in online teaching, if required. There is an urgent need for more current research, both globally and locally, into how GIS can be used more in secondary school pedagogy.",

In park system planning, the traditional measure of equitable access to parks has been the 10-minute walk isochrone, determining what percentage of residents live within a short walk of a park. However, these metrics do not capture inequities in park access for different demographic groups, nor do they consider the quality of parks that communities have access to. This research project explored a methodology to layer in considerations of park size, population density, and demographic characteristics to allow a more nuanced look at the equity of park access in urbanized areas across the United States. PyQGIS and Rgeoda are two open source platforms used for this analysis to allow for localized analysis at the national scale, as well as to make this analysis available to cities, towns, and other researchers interested in parks equity.",

    "speakers": "Ben Hur Pintor",
    "abstract": "Basketball is spatial. Any event that occurs during a basketball game—a made shot, a missed shot, a rebound—has a corresponding spatial or spatio-temporal information embedded in it and, one can argue, that location oftentimes plays an important role in its occurrence or success.\r\n\r\nIf you think of the basketball court as a map, a parcel of the earth, or simply a Cartesian coordinate plane then every location on the court can be specified by a coordinate pair. If we consider one type of basketball event—a shot or field goal—every occurrence of this event on the court will have its own corresponding coordinates. Aside from coordinates, these field goals can also have attributes or marks—the name of the player, the name of the team, the opponent, the time left on the clock, whether the shot was made or not, whether it was defended—that provide other information about the field goal. If we take this collection of field goals, what we actually have is a collection of points in space that is, similar to any spatial point dataset, susceptible to spatial analysis. This is why it makes sense to analyze basketball from a spatial perspective.\r\n\r\nIn countries with advanced player tracking systems, they’ve been able to perform studies and research that challenge conventional wisdom and create a deeper understanding of the spatial aspects of the game.\r\n\r\nFor the past few years, I’ve been trying to do the same in the Philippines even though we do not have advanced player tracking systems and have a severe lack of readily available basketball-related spatial data.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will talk about how spatial concepts and open source technologies can be used to map and spatially characterize the game of basketball by providing examples of spatial analysis and visualization of field goals in the University Athletics Association of the Philippines (UAAP) Men’s Basketball Tournament.",

    "speakers": "Flavia Renata Ferreira",
    "abstract": "The Geological Survey of Brazil has a library of palaeontology symbols to use in geological mapping works, currently in bitmap format and adapted for ESRI platform. This type of representation has presented anti-aliasing problems when reduced, in addition to not being suitable for map presentation on the web, according to OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium) specifications. This work presents a reproducible method in any symbol library type. The method consists of converting the symbol library to open-source format, resulting an OpenType font file, which can be installed on any operating system and view each symbol font in any software that has this functionality, such as a GIS (Geographic Information Systems) software. The need to develop font construction technique is due to improving typographic quality of cartographic representations and making library compatible with main GIS softwares. Those 61 pictorial palaeontology symbols were converted, one by one, to SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) format. We imported each symbol as a glyph in FontForge font editor. Major computer platforms use OpenType format due to its wide availability and typographic flexibility, including provisions to deal with diverse characteristics of internationally symbolic alphabet systems. There is even the possibility of symbols standardizing in the UTF-8 alphabet system, an issue for the scientific community to study. The advantage of using the SVG format is its size, a compact text file, and has an excellent compression factor. In addition, version-control repositories, like GitHub, can store SVG files, which would facilitate content management. The adopted method proved to be applicable to any cartographic symbols library with good results. Rendering tests on different platforms (web or desktop) showed no noticeable differences. One of the most important aspects of the method presented in this work was to make cartographic symbols library public and open-source for use by the geoscientific community, regardless whether an open-source or proprietary platform is used, and so, the Geological Survey of Brazil will be able to distribute geological symbology patterns, according to Open Data definition.",

It is an impact of production of large mass and volume of saturation from the reservoir.

Large fluid volume production leads to the decrease of pore pressure inside reservoir. This decline disturbs the pressure stability and overburden pressure compress the pores. It results the drop in ground surface. The decrease in ground surface level induces a devastating effect in the construction of some facilities, such as building, pipeline, canal, and river. It may interrupt the balance in the ecosystems nearby. Near real time monitoring of subsidce will reduce the risk of possible damage and the other effects related to it.

    "speakers": "Britt Lonneville, Salvador Fernández",
    "abstract": "Marine Regions is a LifeWatch-sponsored project whose purpose is to create a standard list of geographic names coupled with information and maps of their location. In August 2020, Marine Regions released a brand new data product: the High Seas. This data product delimits all parts of the ocean that are not under the control of any single nation (sometimes referred to as ‘international waters’). The dataset is a valuable addition to the already existing data products hosted by Marine Regions. As such, it will further benefit global ocean conservation initiatives and global fisheries management.\r\n\r\nFor this new product, the Marine Regions team consciously made the decision to shift to FOSS tools. This has led to an improved and more reproducible workflow, leveraging the full potential of a suite of FOSS: QGIS, PostgreSQL/PostGIS, GeoServer and GeoNetwork. To make users more familiar with the OGC web services to consult and download the data, the web services tutorial page has been revamped. Additionally, the Marine Regions download page also offers GeoPackages as its first download option for all its products in order to encourage the adoption of open data formats.\r\n\r\nWe discuss in detail how we use these FOSS tools throughout the various steps to create such a global GIS data product. One of those steps is for example the creation of a Pacific-centered version of the High Seas, for which various methods in R, QGIS and PostGIS were examined. Finally, we pinpoint remaining challenges that we would like to see resolved in the future.\r\n\r\nMore info: www.marineregions.org. Contact: info@marineregions.org.",

    "speakers": "Benjamin Herfort",
    "abstract": "Maps play a critical role in disaster response, enabling humanitarian organisations to better identify people in need, coordinate response and provide assistance where it’s needed most. However, many of the communities where disasters occur are literally missing from any map.  First responders working with these communities often have to cover large areas to find out where the population is affected, but lack the data necessary for an efficient, effective response. \r\n\r\nMany tools for mapping in OSM can be daunting for people without a technical or mapping background. This constitutes a high barrier to join open mapping initiatives for beginners and people that are not willing to spend that much time on training or that don’t have access to a laptop. \r\n\r\nMapSwipe is an open-source mobile app that makes it even easier for anyone to contribute to humanitarian mapping, with tasks that can be done in just minutes and in-app tutorials to get started. In this talk we will provide an overview on it from three angles:\r\n\r\n1. community\r\n2. app (react-native)\r\n3. backend (python and postgis).\r\n\r\nSince its start in 2015, MapSwipe has scaled to more than 30,000 users mapping 1,300,000 km2. MapSwipe is built and maintained by volunteers, with the support of the British Red Cross, HeiGIT and the GIScience Research Group, Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team and Medecins Sans Frontieres.",

The perceived level of annoyance (PLA) of the sound based on\r\nthe individual's perspective was also used through this research. An open-source crowdsourcing\r\nsound map is created where users can upload sound recordings, images, and feedback related to\r\nthe soundscape of that particular location.

Besides, in the next years the energy demand will increase with the growth of the Information and Communications Technology sector. To combine these two aspects, future energy needs to be produced with renewable resources and less with fossil fuels.\r\nAn opportunity to discover and plan the use of renewable energy resources are geospatial data derived from satellite acquisitions. The European Earth Observation programme   Copernicus provides multiple datasets in an Open Science approach. Within this paper, multiple datasets offered by Copernicus services are presented in relation to their exploitation for the energy system analysis, with a particular attention to renewable energy. The datasets will be analysed according to their properties and possibility of usage.\r\nAdditional Copernicus satellite derived data that can benefit the emerging topic of the food-energy-water nexus are finally presented to point out significant development in the energy sector which is recently claiming growing attention.",

    "speakers": "Lee, Chengfa Benjamin",
    "abstract": "Seagrasses provide many ecosystem services such as habitat provisioning, biodiversity maintenance, food security, coastal protection, and carbon sequestration. With the projected temperature extremes and sea level rise due to climate change, these important ecosystems are highly threatened. Conserving these important ecosystems requires accurate and efficient mapping of its distribution and trajectories of change. Unfortunately, the spectral similarities between the seagrass and optically deep water pixels in the satellite images, or dark pixel confusion, causes potential classification errors. Within the context of the Global Seagrass Watch project, funded by DLR and supported by the GEO-GEE program, we develop a novel open method within the Google Earth Engine platform to identify and mask out these optically deep water pixels on open Sentinel-2 satellite data. This method yields less confusion and results in a more accurate seagrass detection which could benefit scientists focused on seagrass-related climate science.",

A myriad of methods and workflows exist for ENM; some common steps are common to most of them, but there must be flexibility depending on the research question. Moreover, reporting the methodology and decision-making should give robustness to the conclusions. With the recent emphasis on reproducibility, a new set of practices, such as metadata recording, script-based applications, version control, and software version awareness can be included to the general workflows to ensure transparency. Here, we present modleR, an R package that implements such a reproducibility workflow for Ecological Niche Modeling. We also propose some guidelines for writing reproducible R code in ecology workflows in general.",

    "abstract": "The complex realities of changing climate and biodiversity are imperfectly understood. Bioacoustics is a conservation tool, going where human ears cannot stay and listen. Locally-informed machine learning analysis leads to big data insights, empowering informed decision making. Networks of bioacoustic recorders in some of Earth’s most biodiverse and vulnerable regions (near Everest in Nepal, Madidi National Park in Bolivia, and the Chesapeake Bay watershed in the United States) are bearing witness to a changing climate. More than 1850 days of audio data already collected provide a powerful dataset for studying species distributions. Machine learning (ML) turns this data into information to understand climate change and biodiversity. MLmodels are being trained for a dozen species in Nepal, Bolivia, and USA. Analyzed data show location and time of species vocalization. Modeling can expand rapidly as labeled data is collaboratively created by local experts. Preliminary results from Nepal show that a rare bird species was identified 1,000 feet higher in elevation than previously recorded: probable proof of concept that bird species are migrating uphill with changing climate. Bioacoustics is a valuable tool for species population surveys and biodiversity monitoring.",
